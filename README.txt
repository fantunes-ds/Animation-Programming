1. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING RELEASE AND X86. THE ENGINE DOES NOT SUPPORT OTHER MODES.
2. Press Play
3. If you want to change the animation speed, use 'Y' to slow it down, use 'U' to go faster.
4. If you want to switch between animations, you can use 'O' to go to Walking animation, 'I' to use Running animation.

Notes : The animation doesn't cycle perfectly seamlessly. We skip the last frame so it doesn't slow down the overall animation, 
but he get a very subtil unnatural movement on the right knee as the animation restarts. This is the best we
could do.

There's a bar to show the progress of the animation on the screen. The red bar indicates which frame you are
at, compared to how many (yellow) frames there are in the animation. 
The yellow bars are the keyFrames only, they do not take in consideration the interpolated frames.

You can reverse the animation by slowing it below 0 speed.
